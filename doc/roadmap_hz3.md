Hubzilla III
============

Due: December 2017
Codename: 


Wishlist:

- Move CalDAV/CardDAV server to core

- Integrate Hubzilla events with CalDAV

- Connection 'roles' allows you to select different permission roles for your connections; such as follower, friend, contributor, etc. 

- CardDAV integration with abook and profiles

- App tray

- issues manager

- wiki cloning

- provide easy channel move (as opposed to channel copy or clone), which is currently supported only by the basic server role.

- provide RSA keychange operation; which cannot affect the primary identity (which is based on the channel keys), so add a secondary dynamic key pair which will be used for all other operations and can be upgraded or revoked at any time.
