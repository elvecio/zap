<br>Short answer: No, there isn't. There are reasons. You are able to change permissions to your files, photos and the likes, but not to posts after you have saved them. The main reason is: Once you have saved a post it is being distributed either to the public channel and from there to other Hubzilla servers or to those you intended it to go. Just like you cannot reclaim something you gave to another person, you cannot change permissions to Hubzilla posts. We would need to track everywhere your posting goes, keep track of everyone you allowed to see it and then keep track of from whom to delete it. <br>If a posting is public this is even harder, as Hubzilla is a global network and there is no way to follow a post, let alone reclaim it reliably. Other networks that may receive your post have no reliable way to delete or reclaim the post.<br><br>

<br>Posts and photos/files are provided separately from the channel basic information. This is due to memory limitations dealing with years of conversations and photo archives. Posts and conversations can be synced separately from the basic channel information. Photos and file archives can be transferred using a plugin tool such as 'redfiles', which is currently listed as "experimental".&nbsp;&nbsp;When creating this feature we thought that keeping all your contacts was the most important task. Your friends have already seen your old content. Posts/conversations were next in priority and these may now be synced. Files and photos are the last bit to get completely working. Once we find someone willing to finish implementing this, it will be done. :)<br>

<br>You have probably disabled third party cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to enable them for remote authentication to work.<br>

<br>There are also a lot of <strong>private</strong> foreign language posts and auto-translation services would require us to transmit these private messages to the translation service; and we don't know what they will do with them on their servers. Actually we do know thanks to Edward Snowden. Our best bet is a project called <strong><em>Apertium</em></strong> which is an open source translator we can install locally. It is currently missing German translations - which are the most requested translation in the matrix. Once again, this will be implemented when we find somebody who really wants to make it happen.
