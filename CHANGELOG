	Implement singleton delivery (emulate nomadic identity to singleton networks and services)

		Std-embeds
			New addon to allow a handful of corporate providers to run unfiltered embed code (youtube, vimeo, soundcloud) 
		Various:
			upgrade font-awesome icons and adapt a few addons to Objects and the new hook interface and new controller interface
